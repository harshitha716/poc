Given the following table, search for specific target attributes and extract their corresponding values. Only extract values for the requested attributes.

Target attributes to search for:
{{TARGET_ATTRIBUTES}}

Guidelines for extraction:
1. Only extract values for the specified target attributes
2. Look for semantic matches (e.g., "client_name" might match "customer", "buyer", etc.)
3. Consider both exact and fuzzy matches of attribute names
4. If an attribute is not found, exclude it from the output
5. Ensure values are properly formatted (dates, numbers, currencies)

Table to analyze:
{{METADATA_TABLE}}

Output the found key-value pairs in a JSON format following this structure:
{
    "target_attribute1": "value1",
    "target_attribute2": "value2",
    ...
}

Only include attributes from the target list that were found in the data.
Ensure the output matches:
{{OUTPUT_MODEL}}
