Given the following table, analyze and extract all possible key-value pairs. A key-value pair represents a meaningful attribute and its corresponding value from the data.

Guidelines for extraction:
1. Look for header-value combinations that represent meaningful attributes
2. Consider both single-value and multi-value attributes
3. Standardize key names (remove spaces, use snake_case)
4. Ensure values are properly formatted (dates, numbers, currencies)
5. Include metadata about the document type if apparent

Table to analyze:
{{METADATA_TABLE}}

Output the key-value pairs in a JSON format following this structure:
{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2",
    ...
}

Ensure the output matches:
{{OUTPUT_MODEL}}
