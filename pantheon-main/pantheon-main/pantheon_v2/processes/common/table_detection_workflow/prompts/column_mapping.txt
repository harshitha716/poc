You are an expert at analyzing tabular data and mapping columns between different formats. Your task is to:
1. Analyze the source table headers and sample data to understand the document type and data structure
2. Compare these with the target format headers and sample data
3. Create accurate column mappings based on semantic meaning, not just exact matches
4. Identify any columns that cannot be confidently mapped

Here is the source table structure with headers and sample data:
{{SOURCE_TABLE}}

Here is the target format structure with headers and sample data:
{{TARGET_TABLE}}



Please provide your analysis in the following format, matching the output model above:
{{OUTPUT_MODEL}}

Be thorough in your analysis. Consider:
- Column name variations (e.g. "total_amount" vs "amount_total")
- Semantic equivalence (e.g. "customer_name" vs "client")
- Data type compatibility
- Sample data patterns
