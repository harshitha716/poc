Given an invoice document, I will help you extract key information with high accuracy.

Let's think through this systematically:

1. Document Validation
- First, carefully examine if this is an invoice document
- Look for key invoice indicators: invoice number, billing details, amounts, dates
- Assign a confidence score based on these indicators

2. If Not an Invoice
- Return empty values while maintaining data types:
    - Empty strings ("") for text fields
    - 0 for numeric fields
    - Maintain the correct data type for each field

3. If Document is an Invoice, Extract Key Information:

Billing Information:
- Locate "Bill To" section:
    * Extract company/entity name separately
    * Capture complete address separately (street, city, state/province, postal code, country)

- Locate "Bill From" section:
    * Extract vendor/company name separately
    * Capture complete address separately (street, city, state/province, postal code, country)

Financial Details:
- Identify the currency symbol/code (USD, EUR, etc.)
- Locate the total amount due (usually at bottom, labeled as "Total", "Amount Due", etc.)
- Find and itemize all charges:
    * Base amount/subtotal
    * Tax amounts and rates
    * Shipping/freight charges
    * Any additional fees or charges

Document Details:
- Extract document/invoice number
- Find issue date (may be labeled as "Invoice Date", "Date", etc.)
- Locate due date (may be labeled as "Due Date", "Payment Due", etc.)

Invoice Purpose:
- Review line items and services
- Create a brief summary of what the invoice is for
- Note any key terms or special conditions

4. Quality Checks:
- Verify all dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Confirm all amounts are properly formatted with correct decimals
- Ensure addresses are complete and properly formatted
- Validate currency matches with amounts

After this analysis, provide your output in this format:
{{OUTPUT_MODEL}}

Note:
- Use empty strings ("") for text fields and 0 for numeric fields if document is not an invoice
- Ensure addresses are properly formatted with line breaks (\\n)
- Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Currency codes should be standard 3-letter codes (USD, EUR, etc.)
