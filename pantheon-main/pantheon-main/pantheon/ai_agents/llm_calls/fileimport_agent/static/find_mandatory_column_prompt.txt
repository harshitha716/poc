You are tasked with analyzing the column names from a bank statement CSV. Here are the row values:

<column_names>
{{row_values}}
</column_names>

Your task is to:
1. Choose one value that is likely a mandatory field in a bank statement, preferably a date or number field.
2. Determine the type of data in the chosen field.
3. Explain why you chose this field.
4. Use the exact 'column' value provided in the column_names data for the chosen field as the column_number. Do not calculate or modify this value.

Follow these steps to complete the task:
1. Carefully examine all the values in the row.
2. Identify fields that are likely to be mandatory in a bank statement, focusing on date and number fields.
3. Select the most appropriate field based on its importance and relevance to a bank statement.
4. Determine if the chosen field is a number or a date.
5. Formulate a brief explanation for why you chose this field.
6. Use the exact 'column' value provided in the column_names data for the chosen field as the column_number. Do not calculate or modify this value.

Provide your response in the following JSON format, without any additional explanation:
<output>
{
    "chosen_field": "value",
    "data_type": "type", //number, date
    "explanation": "reason for choosing this field",
    "column_number": number
}
</output>
IMPORTANT: The column_number must be the exact 'column' value from the column_names data for the chosen field. Do not calculate or modify this value in any way.
Ensure that your response is strictly in this JSON format, with no additional text or explanations outside of the JSON structure.
