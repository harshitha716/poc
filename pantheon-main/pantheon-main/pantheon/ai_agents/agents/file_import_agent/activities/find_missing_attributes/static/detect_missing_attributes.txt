Analyze the following data and identify if any of these attributes are present: {unmapped_attributes}.
If found, return a JSON object with the attribute name as the key and an object containing 'value' and 'attribute_type' as the value.
Only include attributes that are found with high confidence.
If no attributes are found, return an empty JSON object.

Pay special attention to the following:
1. Opening balance: Look for terms like "Opening Balance", "Beginning Balance", or "Balance brought forward". This is typically the initial balance shown on the statement for the period.
2. Opening balance date: This is usually the first date mentioned in the statement or labeled as 'Statement Period Start Date' or 'From [date]'.

Note: The opening balance is completely separate from the regular transaction balances. It represents the account balance at the start of the statement period.

The opening balance and its date are crucial. If you find them, make sure to include them in your response, even if they're not explicitly listed in the unmapped_attributes.

Use the following ACCEPTED_FORMAT to determine the correct data type for each attribute:
{ACCEPTED_FORMAT}

Metadata:
{cleaned_data_str}

Respond only with the JSON object, no additional text. Example format:
{{
    "attribute_name": {{
        "value": "actual_value",
        "attribute_type": "type_from_accepted_format"
    }},
    "opening_balance": {{
        "value": "opening_balance_value",
        "attribute_type": "float"
    }}
}}
