bank_statement:
  - initiated_date:
      description: The date when the transaction was first initiated or processed. Common column names include "Value Date" or "Trade Date". Must contain day, month, and year. Time component is optional. This represents when the transaction was started, not necessarily when it affected the account balance.
      type: date
      required: true

  - updated_date:
      description: The date when the transaction was actually applied to the account balance. Common column names include "Posted Date", "Settlement Date", "Booking Date", "Posting Date", "Transaction Date" or "Effective Date". Must contain day, month, and year. Time component is optional.
      type: date
      required: true

  - account_number:
      description: The account number associated with the statement
      type: string
      required: true

  - credit:
      description: The amount credited to the account. Map this for columns representing money added to the account, using terms like "credit", "deposit", "incoming", etc. A row will have either a credit or a debit value, not both. Use sample data to verify this pattern.
      type: float
      required: false

  - debit:
      description: The amount debited from the account. Map this for columns representing money taken from the account, using terms like "debit", "withdrawal", "outgoing", etc. A row will have either a credit or a debit value, not both. Use sample data to verify this pattern.
      type: float
      required: false

  - transaction_amount:
      description: Use this when a single column represents both credits and debits, typically with credits as positive and debits as negative. Do not map if credit and debit are separately identified. Unlike credit/debit, this column will have a value in every row.
      type: float
      required: false

      description: The account balance after the transaction
      type: float
      required: true

  - tag:
      description: User-defined tags for categorizing transactions

      required: false

  note: Credit and debit should not be mapped to the same attribute. If it does, then that value is transaction_amount.
