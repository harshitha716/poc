special_instructions:
  credit_and_debit:
    - Do not rely solely on column names.
    - Analyze data patterns to ensure selection of individual transaction amounts, not aggregated totals.
    - Avoid columns with names like "TOTAL_CRED" or "TOTAL_DEBI" as they likely represent aggregated values.
    - Correct columns should contain varying transaction amounts, not repeated totals or counts.
    - Only map when finding a direct match, never otherwise.
    - If credit and debit are in the same column:
      - Map both credit and debit to this column.
      - Add 'independent_column: false' for both credit and debit in the output.
      - If in separate columns, set 'independent_column: true' (or omit, as true is default).

  date_columns:
    - Ensure selected columns contain valid date information.
    - Pay attention to specific meanings of each date column as described in the accepted format.
    - Applicable to: initiated_date, updated_date

  balance:
    - Should represent account balance after each transaction.
    - Verify values change logically with credits and debits.

  remarks:
    - Should contain descriptive text about each transaction.
    - Ensure it's not confused with other string fields like status or transaction type.
